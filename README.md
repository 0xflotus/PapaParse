Parse CSV with Javascript
========================================

Papa Parse (formerly the jQuery Parse Plugin) is a robust and powerful CSV (character-separated values) parser with these features:

- Easily parses delimited text strings with any delimiter
- Parse CSV files directly (local or over the network)
- Stream large files (even via HTTP)
- Auto-detects the delimiter
- Worker threads to keep your web page responsive
- Header row support
- Can convert numbers and booleans to their types
- Graceful and robust error handling
- jQuery integration to easily parse files from `<input type="file">` elements

All are optional (except for being easy to use).

Papa Parse is the result of a successful experiment by [SmartyStreets](http://smartystreets.com) which matured into a fully-featured, independent Javascript library.
